            message=_"To my knowledge, no. I had been happily living in retirement in Lintanir forest at that time and didn't care much for happenings in the world. Anyway, the Kal Torlat dwarves became divided some time after this. Half of them turned against the others, and the evil side won. All of those dwarves' dark side became obvious then. Digging deep and too greedily, ancient evils must have been awoken in the dark depths. That's all I can tell you about this subject."

            # po: The third sentence is correct as it is; Dulatus's thanks are for the actual things that Kalenz has told, rather than for the act of telling.
            # po: If it were reworded as "for telling us everything", that would have different implications which wouldn't necessarily be accurate, so leave it as it is now:
            message=_"The fate of the Hammer remains unclear. If it is still lying about somewhere, maybe even in the hand of some corrupted former runesmith from Kal Torlat, we must recover it, to eliminate the source of evil that pursues us. Thank you Lord Kalenz, for everything you've told us."
