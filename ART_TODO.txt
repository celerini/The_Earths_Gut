STORY IMAGES
------------
* Fire for the Caverns of Flame
* S07, "The Bridge is Broken": "Leaving their elvish allies behind, the group
  explored deep into the caves, following a wide carved path of dwarven design..."
* S09i, "Trolls Leave": "The trolls led Dulatus into the tunnel leading southwest,
  starting at the known outpost... most of them [would be] leaving when the group
  came into range of old dwarvish buildings again."
* S10, "Old Friends": "Then at some point, the surroundings changed so that even
  the most experienced trolls hadn't ever seen them before. Dulatus was afraid
  that they might have lost their way..."
* S12, "Under Pressure" (Hamel & friends adventuring too deep into the abandoned
  mines and catching the attention of the undead... I'm thinking the dwarves would
  be in the well-lit center, while the undead would be lurking in the shadows
  around the edges)
* S23, "Epilogue" (Hamel & Dulatus meeting up again & agreeing to take the hammer
  back to Relgorn)
